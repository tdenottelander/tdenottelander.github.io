  3D-prints
</h2>

<p class="mb-4 text-center">
  In my spare time I like to create 3D-printed and painted figurines.
  I use a Creality CR10S-Pro to make prints and use acrylic paints to finish them off.
  See the gallery below for some of my creations.

<div class="my-container flex flex-row flex-wrap gap-4">
  <app-print-card
    *ngFor="let print of prints"
    [print]="print"
    class="
      basis-full
      min-[320px]:basis-[calc((100%-1rem)/2)]
      sm:basis-[calc((100%-2rem)/3)]"/>
</div>
